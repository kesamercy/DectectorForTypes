Questions:

1. how do i prompt the user to enter the 2 varaibles as the input arguments in the command line at the start of the program?

2. for the second one, only way i can think of is for loop to skip those lines. Help me here!

3. I can't think of any other way of getting the types and the regex into a list / array / hash map without manually doing it. 

4. finding regx that will match float and integer 




String intString = "4";

		CSVParser otherparser = new CSVParser(new FileReader(args[2]), CSVFormat.DEFAULT.withHeader());

//			for (DataTypes eachType : DataTypes.values()) {
//				
//				System.out.println("the first type ." + eachType);

		for (CSVRecord csvRecord : otherparser) {
			System.out.println("the first in record" + csvRecord.get(1));

			if (intString.matches(csvRecord.get(1))) {

				System.out.println("a match was found wooohhoo " + csvRecord.get(0));

			}

		}
