On the smaller data sets, the program is significantly much faster than the previous version.  

Results from running the data on larger data sets:

- I tested the data on larger data sets with more rows and columns and compared to the previous implementation, the program
ran much faster but honestly, the more data i added the slower it became so from my conclusion, the program might
be faster but I don't know if it's by far compared to the last implementation I had. Which made me wonder, how come it was
signifcantly faster for smaller data sets but maybe a little bit faster than the last implementation when the data sets increased.
I would have thought it would be significantly faster for both the large and small data sets. 


The function where the program spent the most time running in the previous implementation was in the guessDataTypeInEachCol function while for the current implementation,
the time lag  is the findDataTpyesPerCol function.
