This week:
- changed the implemementation for some of the functions becasue reading the odd and even cols required slightly
different logic. 
- finished debugging now things work as expected
- only thing left is cleaning up the regex which i didn't get to finish because of debugging and rethinking the logic of the implementation
- since this is the last week, i will just tidy up things and finish up whatver is not done.
