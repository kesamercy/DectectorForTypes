way forward plan:


4. think about a new implementaion for the threads / reading data.\

things changed:
1. change the name for the num to get from the user
2. clean the data from the regex files
3. get a regex to read floats and ints


Notes:
it's impossible to determine the fraction of data to examine without knowing the number of records in the data.
i don't know any other way of getting the number of records in the file without loading them into memory. 
for now, i thought moving on from an implementation that doesn't require the user to enter a number at
the command line might be a tentative solution. 





trick for the second batch is :

1. if goal is to get immediate response, then you might not need to use threads... you can usethe 
same iterator for both threads.....


2. have one thread for reading the data and then other worker threads to process the data.
DataStrucrure  that can help with this..... check rocket chat for the link to this...

3. One of the queue impelementations for the data from the threads......
reader and worker threads is this method
isolate code needed to read and isolate the code needed to process the records. 
trick is to keep them in sync, the threads would be reading in the data at the same time



hack: split the data in a different 
have the 2 threads take in turns in reading the rows. one thread reads even rows, other thread reads odd rows. 
each thread would have it's own iterator....

- skip lines...
