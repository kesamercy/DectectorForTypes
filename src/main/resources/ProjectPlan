Questions:

2. for the second thread one, only way i can think of is for loop to skip those lines. Help me here!

3. I can't think of any other way of getting the types and the regex into a list / array / hash map without manually doing it. 
	I created a file instead. How's that?
	
4. I'm working on finding regx that will match float and integer so it's not manually input.
