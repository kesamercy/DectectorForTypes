Changes made from last week:
 
 1. return the dominant data type found in each col
 2. Integers now return as integers and not only as float numbers
 3. String types are now detected. Both as a default type and also a matched type. 
 4. Took the code out of main and created a new method to process the file
 5. Started to implement the code when given an Iterable<String[]>. Still needs some work.



Questions for Monday

1. I want to create an array of hash maps to store the types from each col. Is that reasonable?

2. For the data that matches more than one type, should I increment all the types it matches everytime
the data is read? e.g. 5 matches as a float and also an integer so I would increment the float types
and the integer type for that data?
 
3. How do I generically determine the types that match more than one data type?
   That is, wouldn't every type match at least a string.
   
4. Should I add all the regex from the library i found? That is, get all the regex available there
and copy them to my program?
   
   
   
To do next:
fix the pushing to github

have the types map to more than one type 

put the regex in a different function

give the function an iterable string ---- read about java iterable string. this is how the program should prepare to recieve data

make the code elegant 

implement your udnerstanding of matches different types --for  now


break down the code to guess first thousand then confirm the guess.
