Changes made from last week:
1. Implementation now determines types when given an iterable string. 
		 Used an list of HashMaps
		- easier to implement
		- needed to create a seperate class of hashmaps then add them as objects to the array had I used an array to implement this
		- With lists, I could just create the hashMaps directly and add them to the list directly
	
 


Questions for Monday
   
   
To do next:
- get a large number of the regular expressions and use those. --- webscrape the regex. preferably to a different file or fucntion
- each regex should map to it's own type
- put the regex in a different function

- make the code elegant --- look at how to use lamba expressions for some of the implementation already used 

	- put the threads in their own function
	- put determine the highes type in own function
	-
- break down the code to guess first thousand then confirm the guess with the background worker.

To do in the future:
1. have the types map to more than one type 
2. match the different types and increase the count based on the types matched.
