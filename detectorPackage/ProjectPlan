Changes made from last week:
1. Implementation now determines types when given an iterable string. 
		 Used an list of HashMaps
		- easier to implement
		- needed to create a seperate class of hashmaps then add them as objects to the array had I used an array to implement this
		- With lists, I could just create the hashMaps directly and add them to the list directly
		
2. Break down the code to guess first thousand then confirm the guess with the background worker.
	
 


Questions for Monday
   
   
To do next:
- display the highest type from each col.
- change the truth variable to a flag
- modify the messages for the type confirmation in each col. 
- work on the time interval for the program to run
- get a large number of the regular expressions and use those. --- webscrape the regex. preferably to a different file or fucntion
- each regex should map to it's own type
- put the regex in a different function
- make the code elegant --- use lambda expressions to make the code elegant 

Clean Up:

- make the code elegant --- look at how to use lambda expressions for some of the implementation already used 

	- put the threads in their own function
	- put determine the highest type in own function
	- put repeated implementations in functions of their own

To do in the future:
1. have the types map to more than one type 
2. match the different types and increase the count based on the types matched.
