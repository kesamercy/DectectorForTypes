Changes made from last week:
1. have parameters that would determine the split for what section of the data will go to the first thread and which will be at the second thread 
2. change the names --- the varaible names for all the types in the file 
3. the integers are now reconginzed as floats but the floats should not be recongzied as integers. remember the floats should still be able to read
	the floats as an independent type. 
4. scrapped regex
5. Increased the rows and cols of the data. Program is starting to get slow.
Some functions are also starting to break the more the data increases. Working on fixing this.
6. go ahead and increase the num of rows ... do this till it starts to get really slow. 
7. when it gets, slow, start using the profiler and see where the functions are slowing down and modify the implementation accordingly. 


Questions for Monday
   
   
To do next:
// this is being called way too many times, change this...
				conditionMet = testCondition(operator, count, rowsInFirstThread);

				// instead of having it call test condition, have the count till it is equal to
				// numRows --- for the first thread

- get a large number of the regular expressions and use those. --- webscrape the regex. preferably to a different file or fucntion
- put the regex in a different function
- make the code elegant --- use lambda expressions to make the code elegant 

things to do for this week

4. process threads is being called twice yet only half the data is needed for each call. modify this...  
6. use enums for the data type comparisons ---  what is this and how do i use this? how is it applicable to my case... 
	a. what are enums for data types?
8. Modify thread 1 instead of having it call test condition, have the count till it equals num rows for the first thread 
9. start making the data sets bigger. increase the number of cols

12. document the changes made based on the profiler. 
				
				
				
To do in the future:
1. have the types map to more than one type 
2. match the different types and increase the count based on the types matched.
