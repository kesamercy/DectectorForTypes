Changes made from last week:
1. Implementation now determines types when given an iterable string. 
 


Questions for Monday
   
   
To do next:

- finish the iterable string function implementation - hash tables in array
1. explain why we changed from array to list
	- try using a list map
	- try using an array 
	- compare the tentative solutions and weigh pros and cons then decide
- get a large number of the regular expressions and use those. --- webscrape the regex. preferably to a different file or fucntion
- each regex should map to it's own type
- put the regex in a different function

- make the code elegant 
- break down the code to guess first thousand then confirm the guess with the background worker.
- always have different options for the desgin and compare them with each other and list pros and cons for each to determine which is more feasbil


To do in the future:
1. have the types map to more than one type 
2. match the different types and increase the count based on the types matched.
