Changes made from last week:
1. Implementation now determines types when given an iterable string. 
		 Used an list of HashMaps
		- easier to implement
		- needed to create a seperate class of hashmaps then add them as objects to the array had I used an array to implement this
		- With lists, I could just create the hashMaps directly and add them to the list directly
		
2. Break down the code to guess first thousand then confirm the guess with the background worker.

3. 

Questions for Monday
   
   
To do next:
- get a large number of the regular expressions and use those. --- webscrape the regex. preferably to a different file or fucntion
- put the regex in a different function
- make the code elegant --- use lambda expressions to make the code elegant 

To do in the future:
1. have the types map to more than one type 
2. match the different types and increase the count based on the types matched.
